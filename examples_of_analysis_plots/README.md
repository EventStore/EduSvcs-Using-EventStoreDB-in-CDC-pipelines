# Examples of Analysis Enabled by EventStoreDB and projection Engine

The 'python' folder contains two programs that read from streams generated by the CDC pipeline and perform statistical analysis in pandas.

1. analysis_by_sql_operation.py
2. analysis_of_rows_per_transaction.py

Running those programs generates the plots seen below.

While more complex analysis could be done, this project's aim is to introduce the utility of having EventStoreDB as part of your CDC pipeline.
