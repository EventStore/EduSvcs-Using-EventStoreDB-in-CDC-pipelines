I think I am at the following place. 

The Readme from my github repo is now in place as the Readme in the docker scripts folder

The Readme in the top level is basically what will become the pdf for Learn Worlds or whatever

To DO

1. The code_example.md, should be moved into the python directory
2. The generation of a pandas dataframe, and running the pandas profiler should be tweaked, how about a bar chart of deletes vs, updates, vs inserts. And the pandas profiler for kicks. 

In order to do #2, I need a big SQL file that performs a bunch of random operations. 

To Maybe DO..
Removing the constraints on the customer table would make things a LOT easier. Or I could just add random numbers to emails.

I need to make sure my requirements.txt and venv work, as I recall I needed to roll back to python 3.11 in order to get numba to work.  Check with my local repo for requirements to verify.
