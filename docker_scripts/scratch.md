# Features of EventStoreDB

EventStoreDB provides the following functionality.

* Durable and immutable log of events (I don't know what else to call them here)
* Guaranteed ordering of those events
* Ability to subscribe to those events (either globally or more granularly)
* Granular enforcement of consistency guarantees
* Granular access control

Given those features, EventStoreDB can be critical in managing your data flow.
